The configuration options are:

* Keyboard shortcut for note browser mode: A keyboard shortcut to toggle note browser mode (e.g.: ```Ctrl+Alt+N```)

* "Use a single list for fields": Boolean (i.e. ```true``` or ```false```). It controls what is shown in the ```fields``` menu. If true, every single field of every note type is in the same list. If false, fields will be grouped by note type into sub-menus.

* "Show internal fields": Enable even more columns that map to database fields related to the cards and notes (dev option)
